              <p Title="Description">The Mediocre Card Game is a simple WPF-based strategy card game that pits the player against a CPU opponent.
                  The player and CPU take turns playing cards to gain points against each other, while also trying to block their opponent's plays.
                  The game features customizable game rules that allow you to play the game in many different ways.
                  The game can be downloaded completely for free <a href="https://github.com/Finnyins/MediocreCardGame">here</a>.
