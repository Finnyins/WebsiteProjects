              <p Title="About Me">I am Finn O'Brien. I am currently enrolled in my second year of EVIT's Computer programming and mobile app design course.<br>
                I enjoy programming, playing video games, as well as working with electronics and hardware.<br>
                I have fundamental knowledge of C# and Python. I have passed certification tests for both C# and Python. I have made quite a few projects using these languages,<br>
                ranging from basic command-line applications to full-fledged graphical projects with working graphical user interfaces.<br>
                I really enjoy making applications using the WPF and Windows Forms application formats.<br>
                I am really excited to learn HTML, as having even a basic understanding of how websites work will be incredibly useful.<br>

              <p>
                Currently, I'm working on learning HTML and CSS. After that, I'll begin learning the Kotlin language, and practice development of Android applications.
                After that, I'm planning on going to college to continue my programming education, as well as possibly getting an internship somewhere so I can learn in a workplace environment.
                I want to continue to diversify my skillset when it comes to programming, learning a variety of languages with a wide range of uses. Javascript especially interests me,
                as it's use in website scripting is a crucial element of lots of websites, and it allows for very powerful and complex websites to be made using it's scripting.
                My GitHub account can be found <a href="https://github.com/Finnyins">here</a>, where a public archive of my projects can be found. If you need to contact me, you can do so via <a href="mailto: fobri379@evit.com">my E-mail</a>
