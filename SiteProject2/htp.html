            <h1>How To Play</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
              When playing the Mediocre Card Game, players take turns trying to score points on their opponent using "offensive turns".<br>
              Then, the opposing player is then allowed to take a "defensive turn",<br>
              which will allow the defending player a chance to either block or reduce the amount of points the offensive player will earn.<br>
              The game will continue until both players run out of cards, at which point the player with the most points will win.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Offensive Turns</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                After a player's defensive turn ends, That same player will take their offensive turn.<br>
                During your offensive turn, you may play a single card from your hand, and afterwards your opponent will take their defensive turn.<br>
                Once your opponent's defensive turn is over, you will earn an amount of points equal to the value of the card you played<br>
                minus the value of the card played by your opponent. If the value of the card played by your opponent is greater than or equal to the value of your played card,<br>
                or your opponent's played card is a "Wild" card, then you will not earn any points. Playing a Wild card during an offensive turn will give you zero points.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Defensive Turns</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                After a player takes their offensive turn, the opposing player will take their defensive turn.<br>
                During your defensive turn, you will get the opportunity to play one of the cards from your hand to reduce or negate the value of your opponent's played card.<br>
                If you play a value that is greater than or equal to the opponent's currently played card, it will block the card and your opponent will get zero points.<br>
                Wild cards are special cards that can block any card during a defensive turn, but have no use during an offensive turn.<br>
                If you play a Wild card during your defensive turn, your opponent will earn no points regardless of the value of their played card.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>End of Round</h2>
            <p>
                Once a player's defensive turn ends, the round will end and the played cards will be discarded. 
                The offensive player will earn an amount of points equal to the value of the offensive player's card minus the value of the defensive player's card.
                If the defensive player played a greater card, equal card, or a wild card during their defensive turn, the offensive player will earn no points.
                After the round ends, The defensive player will then take their offensive turn, and the game will continue until both players run out of cards.
