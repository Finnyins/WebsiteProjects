              <p Title="About Me">I am Finn O'Brien. I am currently enrolled in my second year of EVIT's Computer programming and mobile app design course.<br>
                I enjoy programming, playing video games, as well as working with electronics and hardware.<br>
                I have basic fundamental knowledge of C# and Python. I have made quite a few projects using these languages,<br>
                ranging from basic command-line applications to full-fledged graphical projects with working graphical user interfaces.<br>
                I really enjoy making applications using the WPF and Windows Forms application formats.<br>
                I am really excited to learn HTML, as having even a basic understanding of how websites work will be incredibly useful.<br>

              <p Title="Main Project Showcase">I am currently working on making improvements to an existing project I created, Titled "The Mediocre Card Game".
                The game has seen many improvements since I presented it as an assignment for my EVIT class, and I plan on improving it further as time goes on.
                The project files can be downloaded from the github repository <a href="https://github.com/Finnyins/MediocreCardGame">here</a>.
